# Installation Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to install the components using the `install.py` script.

## Listing Available Targets

To see the list of available installation targets, run the following command:

```bash
./install.py list-targets
```

This will display all the targets that can be installed individually.

## Installing Specific Targets

To install specific targets, provide the target names as arguments to the script. For example:

```bash
./install.py target1 target2
```

Replace `target1` and `target2` with the actual target names you wish to install.

## Installing All Targets

To install all available targets, simply run:

```bash
./install.py all
```

This will install all components available in the script.
